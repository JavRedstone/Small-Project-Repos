**Cave Generator**

This cave generator is a based on random generation of directions.

It uses double arrays in order to create a grid, in which the blocks can be modified.

To visualize this, an html document is needed, which can be seen here:

Here is a demo image:

You can download this yourself and open the html document in browser to view the results too.

*To customize this*

You can change the values inside the *// Settings* tab in the beginning to achieve different results - the variables names are self-explanatory.

Enjoy!
