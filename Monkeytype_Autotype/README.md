**Monkeytype autotype**

Autotyper for monkeytype, "https://monkeytype.com/", used for entertainment purposes only.

Steps:

1. Open the inspect window on monkeytype, switch to console view, and paste in the code from `monkeytype_autotype.js`, press enter.
2. Copy the output (Make sure not to copy) the debugger number (e.g.: VM36:8).

**Example of potential output**:
`line will off hold call few at but form open early these long get feel plan by between word should so over but for school much over year interest high keep come as when large any she group public ask even or last he just could against like end play late early order because large high find will public so open set state could become hold fact use these tell want those after over which out problem not say may begin now time while out part need call many so because how would again very there should through group follow `

3. Run the `monkeytype_autotype.py` file, and when it promps to ask for the console.log output, paste what you have, press enter.
4. Make sure to switch tabs fast enough and to put monkeytype on focus in order for the stimulated key presses to happen -- there is a three second delay between the enter of the output and the typing.
5. With the current settings, you should get around 760 to 770 wpm in the `words 100` configuration in monkeytype.
6. Play around with the settings for different monkeytype modes / to acheive different wpms. You can get "infinite" wpm when setting the `interval` variable in `monkeytype_autotype.py` to 0 (right now it is 0.01).
