**Estimate PI:**

Original question and source Python code found from "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvimAM_SLic" (Joma Tech).

*Question:*

A function called random generates a number from zero to one, randomly, and is uniformly distributed. Calculate the number PI.

*This project shows the code written in NodeJS*

The first file, `estimate_pi.js` shows a clear Python to NodeJS translation of the source code. The second file, `estimate_pi_simplified.js` shows a much more compact version of the first file, which may be a bit more confusing, but reaches the same goal.

To run the first file, type: `node estimate_pi.js` in the terminal. To run the second file, type: `node estimate_pi_simplified.js` (And make sure that you have node installed: "https://nodejs.org/en/download/")
